Project Plan Overview

    Define Features:
        Clearly outline the key features: login, registration, product browsing, categories, deals, filters, cart management, checkout, purchase flow, and selling functionality.
        Break these down into specific API endpoints. For example:
            POST /login
            POST /register
            GET /products
            POST /cart
            POST /checkout, etc.

    Define the Data Model:
        Design the database schema to support these features.
        Tables might include Users, Products, Categories, Deals, Carts, Orders, OrderItems, etc.
        Include relationships, indexes, and constraints necessary for efficient data handling.

    Create the Data Model:
        Implement the schema in SQLite using SQLAlchemy or directly via SQL.
        Populate tables with sample data to allow for realistic testing of your API.

    Develop the Backend with Flask:
        Implement the API endpoints according to the features defined in step 1.
        Use Flaskâ€™s routing and request handling to map URLs to functionality.
        Ensure endpoints can interact with the database correctly.
